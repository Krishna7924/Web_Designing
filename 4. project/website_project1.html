        Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. 
        It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his 
        peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told
        in two parts: the first is set in Naruto's pre-teen years (volumes 1–27), and the 
        second in his teens (volumes 28–72). The series is based on two one-shot manga by 
        Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's 
        monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).Naruto was serialized in 
        Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from September 1999 to November 2014
        ,with its chapters collected in 72 tankōbon volumes. Part I of the manga was adapted 
        into an anime television series by Pierrot and Aniplex, which ran for 220 episodes from
        October 2002 to February 2007 on TV Tokyo; the English dub of the series aired on 
        Cartoon Network and YTV from September 2005 to December 2009. A second series, which 
        adapts material from Part II of the manga, is titled Naruto: Shippuden and ran on TV 
        Tokyo for 500 episodes from February 2007 to March 2017. The English dub of Shippuden 
        was broadcast on Disney XD in the United States from October 2009 to November 2011, 
        airing the first 98 episodes before eventually switching over to Adult Swim's Toonami 
        programming block in January 2014, starting over from the first episode. After Disney 
        XD removed the series from broadcast, Viz Media began streaming new English dubbed 
        episodes on their streaming service Neon Alley in from December 2012 to March 2016, 
        starting at episode 99 and ending at episode 338 due to the service's shutdown. Besides 
        the anime television series, Pierrot also developed 11 animated films and 12 original 
        video animations (OVAs). Other Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video 
        games, and trading cards developed by several companies.Viz Media licensed the manga 
        and anime for North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital Weekly 
        Shonen Jump magazine. The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada in 
        2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The films 
        and most OVAs from the series were also released by Viz, with the first film premiering 
        in movie theaters. The story of Naruto continues with Naruto's son, Boruto Uzumaki, in 
        Boruto: Naruto Next Generations: Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of 
        following his father's.Naruto is one of the best-selling manga series in history having 
        250 million copies in circulation worldwide in 47 countries and regions, with 153 million
        copies in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz
        Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared
        on USA Today and The New York Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume 
        won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character development, strong 
        storylines, and well-executed action sequences, though some felt the latter slowed the story
        down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use of cultural
        references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.

    A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land 
    of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader
    of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, at the cost of his life, seals the fox 
    inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, making him a host of the beast.[i] The 
    Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often 
    scorned by Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the 
    Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns nothing about the 
    Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to him. 
    Naruto defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka Umino.[ii] Shortly
    afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often 
    competes, and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced 
    sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7
    completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards
    to performing assassinations.After several missions, including a major one in the Land of
    Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam, enabling them to advance to a higher rank
    and take on more difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams. During the exams, Orochimaru, a
    wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya, one of the
    three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for 
    Tsunade whom he chooses to become Fifth Hokage instead.During the search, it is revealed 
    that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic heritage, the 
    Sharingan.[iii] After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi,[iv] who 
    had showed up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the
    strength needed to kill Itachi. The story takes a turn when Sasuke leaves the village: 
    Tsunade sends a group of ninja, including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable
    to persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up on Sasuke; Naruto 
    leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare himself for the next time he 
    encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice.

    Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya. The Akatsuki
    starts kidnapping the hosts of the powerful Tailed Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja
    fight against them and search for their teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in 
    capturing and extracting seven of the Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts except Gaara,
    who is now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take 
    revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns from the Akatsuki founder Tobi that 
    Itachi had been ordered by Konoha's superiors to destroy his clan to prevent a coup; he 
    accepted, on the condition that Sasuke would be spared. Devastated by this revelation, 
    Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat several 
    Akatsuki members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader, Nagato, kills Jiraiya and devastates 
    Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him, earning the village's respect and admiration.
    With Nagato's death, Tobi, disguised as Madara Uchiha (one of Konoha's founding fathers), 
    announces that he wants to capture all nine Tailed Beasts to cast an illusion powerful 
    enough to control all humanity and achieve world peace. The leaders of the five ninja 
    villages refuse to help him and instead join forces to confront his faction and allies.
    That decision results in a Fourth Shinobi World War between the combined armies of the Five
    Great Countries (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces) and Akatsuki's forces of zombie-like
    ninjas. The Five Kage try to keep Naruto, unaware of the war, in a secret island turtle near
    Kumogakure (Hidden Cloud Village), but Naruto finds out and escapes from the island with 
    Killer Bee, the host of the Eight-Tails. At that time, Naruto—along with the help of Killer
    Bee—gains control of his Tailed Beast and the two of them head for the battlefield.
    During the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha and not Madara as he claimed.
    Obito is a former teammate of Kakashi's who was thought to be dead. The real Madara saved 
    Obito's life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, 
    including the circumstances that led to his clan's downfall, he decides to protect the 
    village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans. However, Madara's
    body ends up possessed by Kaguya Otsutsuki, an ancient princess who intends to subdue all
    humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya is sealed,
    Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the
    Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts
    Sasuke to dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle
    , Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and 
    pardons Sasuke for his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries Hinata 
    Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation.
